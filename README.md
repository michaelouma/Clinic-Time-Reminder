# Clinic Appointment Reminder Automation

This project is a **Python automation script** that sends **email reminders to clinicians** about patients who have upcoming appointments. It reads appointment data from an Excel file, identifies patients due **tomorrow**, and sends an automated email listing those patients. It also updates the appointment status in the Excel file to ensure no duplicate reminders.
